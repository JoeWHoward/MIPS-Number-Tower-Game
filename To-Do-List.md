# To-Do List
### **Program Functionality**
1. Random number generation (Andrew)
  * And storing those numbers into a 2-dimensional array (more thoughts on this appreciated)
2. Number comparison
  * Accessing the random array and comparing it with the values input by the user
3. Displaying the board to the user (Joe)
  * Spacing function to create appropriate spacing based on what row is being printed
  * At first I was thinking we would use a bitmap display, this seems like too much of a challenge, we should figure out a good way to display the info to the user through the console, including where their cursor is (maybe through ascii symbols?)
4. Displaying cursor to the user

### **Project Deliverables**
1. Video Demonstration
  * We must record a video of the functionality of the program and post it on YouTube
  * Video must have audio narration explaining the functionality of the program
2. User Manual
  * How to run and how to use the game
3. A Project Report
  * Description of the program
  * Challenges our team had and how we overcame them
  * What we have learned by doing this project
  * A discussion of algorithms and techniques used in this project
  * Contributions of each team member
  * Any suggestions we may have (optional)
