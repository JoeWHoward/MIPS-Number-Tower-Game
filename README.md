# MIPS-Number-Tower-Game
This is a semester project for CS 3340 University of Texas at Dallas.

I do not authorize redistribution, derivative works, nor modification for academic purposes, namely don't plagiarize this.

This project was very stressful, if you find yourself here I bid you well, I commented as much of my code as possible.  Godspeed.

Minimum requirements while implementing the game:

    The game is for a human player. Your program provides the gaming environment to the player.
    The player input (keystrokes) should be minimum
    The ASCII based display is the minimum requirement. Creative ways to display the game will earn the team extra credits.
    All moves by the user MUST be valid according to the rules of the game.
    An error message is displayed to explain why an input from the user was not valid. If the user provides a number that the program cannot validate (e.g. no surrounding numbers) issue a warning and ask the player to confirm.


Extra credits will be given for:
    Graphic display
    Extra features of the programs (e.g. sounds or music to indicate valid/invalid moves and winning, display of timing of each guess, etc...) implemented and documented.
    Music is played on winning or while in the background during the game.
    Any other notable creativity that the team has shown.
    Please document these extra credit features in your report and explain well to unlock these extra credits.
