# MIPS-Number-Tower-Game
This is a semester project for CS 3340 with Nhut Nguyen at University of Texas at Dallas.


At the end of the semester, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing

1. A project report (in Word format) covering

    a) a description of the program,
    
    b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,
    
    c) what you have learned by doing the project,
    
    d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program,
    
    e) contributions of each team member (peer evaluation), 
    
    f) any suggestions you may have (optional).
    

2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the behavior of your program.

3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program.

4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.

Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1 must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).

Make sure you write what have you learned by doing this project and peer evaluation part individually.

Minimum requirements while implementing the game:

    The game is for a human player. Your program provides the gaming environment to the player.
    The player input (keystrokes) should be minimum
    The ASCII based display is the minimum requirement. Creative ways to display the game will earn the team extra credits.
    All moves by the user MUST be valid according to the rules of the game.
    An error message is displayed to explain why an input from the user was not valid. If the user provides a number that the program cannot validate (e.g. no surrounding numbers) issue a warning and ask the player to confirm.


Extra credits will be given for:
    Graphic display
    Extra features of the programs (e.g. sounds or music to indicate valid/invalid moves and winning, display of timing of each guess, etc...) implemented and documented.
    Music is played on winning or while in the background during the game.
    Any other notable creativity that the team has shown.
    Please document these extra credit features in your report and explain well to unlock these extra credits.

How will marks be given to team members?
    First, the implementation and documentation of the game will be graded based on the requirements listed above.
    Then the peer evaluation section of the project report (section e) will be taken into consideration when assigning marks to each team member. 
    Teams should get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each team member.Feel free to contact the TA/Grader or the instructor if more information is needed.

Happy coding!
